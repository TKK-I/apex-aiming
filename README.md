Over time, with approx. 1500 hours in Apex Legends and 150 hours aim training, I've been keeping a list of things that help maximize aim training benefits.

# Tools required
* [Kovaak's Aim Trainer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/824270/KovaaK_20_The_Meta/) (preferred, for now) or
* [Aimgod](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1100990/Aimgod/)

# Recommended aim guides
* [Aimer7's workout routines](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vaba3potfhf9jy1/KovaaK%20aim%20workout%20routines.pdf?dl=0) - the defacto standard for aim training guides.  Pretty much always start here at beginner
* [Sparky aim training routines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BPiDxbaqQVxInKwFfdr_AJdJDYVGKbUBGHJDKOeUy-Q/edit#heading=h.4t7np37336xm) - after maturing through into intermediate on Aimer7's guide and hitting plateaus, I started transitioning to this guide instead
* [Sparky aim training benchmarks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vHiQRZMBJlmI69-SgHm3i0eS5ALfq2hEu-ZPyvC6ycE/edit) - I use these to get a general sense of where I'm at in my aim progression

# General aim tips
1. Put your hand/mouse in uncomfortable positions on your mousepad.  Try to minimize re-centering your mouse in places you're used to.  This will help you with in-game scenarios when your mouse is in sub-optimal positions.

2. It should kind of 'hurt' sort of like working out.  Not be totally sore where your hand is unusable but you are training small muscle fibers.  Really helps with precision

3. Focus on a combination close/mid/long range scenarios.  They use different aim types (arm/wrist/finger) and train different muscles.  I found myself doing a ton of 'close fast strafes invincible' but doing really poorly midrange strafes until I started focusing that more

4. In general when doing clicking, focus on precision when doing smaller targets and speed when doing larger targets.  If at any point you find yourself struggling with clicking scenarios, slow down and focus on precision.  Aim for between 80-95% accuracy generically.  Train 'reload' specific scenarios if you want to focus on speed since you aren't penalized for accuracy, but if you find yourself reloading a lot, slow down and focus on precision  

5. Don't avoid the harder scenarios or the ones you dislike.  It's natural to veer to scenarios you do well in and it will feel more fun.  you'll progress better by putting yourself in uncomfortable positions.  If you struggle, you can just turn down the time scale and slowly raise it over time

6. If you find yourself 'zoning out' or not really focusing on the goals/objectives of what you're trying to achieve, your gains will be severely hampered.  You should actively be considering what you're weak at, where you need improvement, and focusing on getting the most out of your training.  Sometimes you just need to take a break for awhile if your heart isn't in it.  Playing music to help focus (sort of like with studying) can help.  Whatever techniques you use to help focus apply here

7. When following routines, make sure to play the entire routine but just reduce the amount of time played if you can't play for an hour or more.  Usually I'll train for ~30 minutes before hopping into Apex for the day
